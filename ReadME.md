# A MxNet implementation of Capsule

ToDo:
* Test
* Train with FC parts
* revised ReadMe
* some fancy plots

# Reference
[Capsule\_MxNet](https://github.com/AaronLeong/CapsNet_Mxnet)

Some codes are cropped from this repo, However I'm concerned with its implementation

[Capsule\_Keras](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras)

Very nice Keras implemtation which clarifies some concepts. I'm still confused with the stop gradient parts.

[MxNet pull #8787](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/8787)

A Capsule implementation which uses old symbol system.
